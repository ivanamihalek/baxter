## Building and starting docker services


```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=something
docker compose up -d baxter-mariadb
```
Docker-compose reads `docker-compose.yml` file.
Note that `-d` will put the service  in the background.


```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=something
docker compose up -d baxter-backend
```

```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=something
docker compose up -d baxter-frontend
```

Note that the sub-commands `create` and `start` can be sued to decouple these two operations:
```bash
docker compose create baxter-frontend
docker compose start baxter-backend
```

## Pitfalls

If using [django-configurations](https://django-configurations.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
to separate the dev and prod settings,  make sure that the correspondind docker-compose.yml file
define teh env variable `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` as `Production`
```yaml
    environment:
        DJANGO_CONFIGURATION: Production
        MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
```
Also, in the settings, in the class `Production`  and in the class `Developent`
the CORS_AALLOWED_ORIGINS should be different:
```python
class Development(Base):
    # development settings here...
    DEBUG = True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        "http://localhost:3000",  # Next.js frontend
    ]
```
versus
```python
class Production(Base):
    # production settings here...
    DEBUG = False
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['baxter-backend-ctnr']
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        "http://baxter-backend-ctnr:3000",  # Next.js frontend
    ]

```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
bash> docker compose up -d baxter-frontend

is a meaningless error message. It could be anything. Try running dovker build in the
corresponding directory to see the output and th actual problem
